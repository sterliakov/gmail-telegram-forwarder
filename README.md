# Forward gmail emails to telegram.

This was built for a single person, so I'm fine with having to reauthenticate
every week to avoid dealing with extended verification of google dev account.
GMail scopes are restricted, so that verification would include a paid security
audit - it isn't sustainable for a private project.

Anyone can deploy a fork of this repository to AWS and stay within free tier -
essentially for free. If you want to do so, please open an issue - I will update
this README with detailed steps.
